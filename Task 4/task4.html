                As many of the tourist attractions in Ho Chi Minh City aer located in Ditrict One, the center of the
                city, it may seem like figuring out how to get around is easy. It would be a shame though not to get out
                of the city center and discover the treasures some of the orther districts have to offer. Getting to
                those parts might seem challenging, but there aer actually many different options to get around.
                Efficiently and cheap.

                    Xe Om is the local name for a motorbike
                    taxi. It's one of the most efficient and
                    cheap ways to get from one place to another
                    in the most central districts (1-5 and 7).
                    Some drivers might have a rough driving
                    style, but dont's worry, they're used to Ho
                    Chi Minh City's crazy traffic. Plus, you can
                    always ask them to slow down if you don't
                    feel comfortable. The Vietnamese are super
                    kind, remember?

                    When you have to go a little further, take
                    the bus! Especially if you want to visit
                    tourist attractions that are not located in
                    the city center. The public bus system in
                    incredibly developed in Ho Chi Minh City and
                    it's also incredibly cheap. Taking a bus in
                    a foreign country might sound a little
                    tricky and adventurous, but give it a try,
                    it might be easier than you think!

                    It goes without saying that taking a taxi is
                    always an easy option to get around a city,
                    but it's also more expensive. Grab is
                    definitely a good alternative. It's a
                    service like Uber (they have actually merged
                    with Grab all around South East Asia) and it
                    works exactly the same. Download the app,
                    put in your pick up location and destination
                    and the closest driver will come and pick
                    you up! Extra plus, you'll know in advance
                    what you have to pay.

                    service. It's a super-easy way to see lots
                    of tourist attractions around the city
                    center, getting on and off whe-rever you
                    like. The buses have air conditioning, free

                    French, Indonesian, German, ... Traveling in

                    for 24 hours so you can stay a any tourist
                    attraction as long as you want and just

                    ideal for long distances, but it's a lot of

                    With a population of approximately 8,5 million
                    people, it goes without saying traffic can be
                    quite chaotic. Or that's what it looks like at
                    least, with over 7,5 million motorbikes and 700
                    000 cars. However, the Vietnamese are used to
                    controlling the chaos. Ignoring traffic signs
                    and signals, driving on the sidewalk and
                    everyone maneuvering around each other
                    efficiently is actually exactly what makes Ho
                    Chi Minh City's traffic flow steadily. Even
                    though it might seem completely insane. <br> <br>
                    If you're on foot and want to cross the street,
                    our best advice is to look to the left and the
                    right, walk confidently, but slowly and
                    consistently keep one hand in the air.
                    Definitely do not run! Cars and motorbike will
                    need some time to notice you and adjust their
                    speed. We're not gonna lie, this might be pretty
                    scary the first time, but you'll get the hang of
                    it!</p>

                    Having arranged an airport pickup beforehand is
                    smartest thing to do in every country. No need
                    to find the bus stops or waiting in line for a
                    taxi. Or worse, get scammed because you
                    obviously look like a tourist. So if you can
                    find a driver or order a taxi before you get on
                    that plane, we suggest you do! <br> <br>
                    However, if you forgot, there are some other
                    options. Taking a Taxi (again, be aware of
                    crooks) or Grab or take a bus. Public bus 152 is
                    cheap and takes you to downtown HCM. Yellow bus
                    109 does the same,but is a little more fancy,
                    comfortable, and therefore, more expensive. The
                    last option is taking Shuttle Bus 49 with
                    drop-off points in the city center and at big
                    hotels.</p>
