                from the older generation speak English sp the language barrier can be an issue sometimes. However, the
                Vietnamese are extremelt friendly and welcoming, so even though you may not speak the same language,
                they will certainly give you a friendly smile. Just smile back<br><br>
                Vetnamese is among the twenty most spoken languages in thw world and there are around eighty million
                people worldwide who speak it. Just a fun fact you can show off with to your driends and family</p>

                Know you Doing from your Dollar. Ho Chi Minh (along with the rest of Vietnam) uses the Vietnamese Dong
                as the local currency. We would recommend that you exchange currency before you arrive in Vietnam.
                However, if that's not possible, there aer many safe currency exchange shops located all around Ho Chi
                Minh City

            <p class="bold">Some simple currency calculations aer as follows:</p><br>

            <p class="bold">100 AUD = 1,600,000 VND (approximately)</p>

                Cash is king in Ho Chi Minh. Always carry a handful of 20,000 VND to 200,000 VND notes (valued from 0.85
                USD to 8.60 USD) for daily expenses and haggling. Most main restaurants and shops do accept credit cards
                though, so bringing one too might be a good idea. Especially if you want to withdraw money from one of
                the many ATMs, which are conveniently located in most places around the city.

                To enter Vietnam, you will need to bring a passport, obviusly. Make sure that it is still valid for at
                least three months after the date that you enter, otherwise you will be stopped at the border. <br>

                If you need to obtain a visa, you can get a "visa on arrival", a very quick and easy process. You simply

                arrive in Ho Chi Minh City. They then will grant you a visa and add it to you passport. We recommend 'My
                Vietnam Visa' <br>

                Ho Chi Minh City has a tropical climate - it's very much a typical steaming het Southeast Asian
                metropolis where you can expect it to be either hot and dry, or hot and wet all throughout the year.
                Regardless when, you'll never need more than one layer of clothing in Ho Chi Minh City. An umbrella
                might come in handy though, better safe then sorry.

                The cost of a Vietnam sim card is around 200,000 rupees (10-10 USD) for unlimited data. Our personal
                recommendation would be to use Viettel or Mobifone, they are two of the most trusted wireless providers.
                No need to worry though if you'd rather not buy one, most cafes and restaurant have WiFi and the
                connection is usually pretty good.

                Negotiating in Vietnam is widely seen and therefore a 100% acceptable when you're at local shops or

                always love to support the locals in Ho Chi Minh City, but you also want to feel like you are getting a
                fair price given the situation. Meet in the middle.

                Unlike the United States, there's not an expected tipping culture in Vietnam. However, locals really
                appreciate it when you tip them for a job well done. They don's expect a large tip, just a few Dong will
                do fine. One thing to note is that some restaurants will automatically add a 'service fee' to the bill,
                usually about 10%.

                Pickpockets! Always keep your valuables, like wallets, phones and jewelry out of sight (defnitely don't
                put them in your pocket). Ho Chi Minh City can be pretty chaotic and a handbag can be easily grabbed by
                a passing motorbike or by someone with bad intentions just bumping into you in the street. These trained
                thieves are so good, you won't even realize what has happend until they're long gone.
