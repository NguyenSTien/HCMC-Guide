                Know you Doing from your Dollar. Ho Chi Minh (along with the rest of Vietnam) uses the Vietnamese Dong as the local currency. We would recommend that you exchange currency before you arrive in Vietnam. However, if that's not possible, there aer many safe currency exchange shops located all around Ho Chi Minh City
            </p><br>
            <p class="bold">Some simple currency calculations aer as follows:</p><br>
            <p class="bold">100 USD = 2,300,000 VND (approximately)</p>
            <p class="bold">100 AUD = 1,600,000 VND (approximately)</p>
            <p class="bold">100 EUR = 2,560,000 VND (approximately)</p>

                Cash is king in Ho Chi Minh. Always carry a handful of 20,000 VND to 200,000 VND notes (valued from 0.85 USD to 8.60 USD) for daily expenses and haggling. Most main restaurants and shops do accept credit cards though, so bringing one too might be a good idea. Especially if you want to withdraw money from one of the many ATMs, which are conveniently located in most places around the city.
